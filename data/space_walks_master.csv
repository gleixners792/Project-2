Hague also inspected sockets on P6 so the foot restraints could be attached. This spacewalk was supposed to be done by Anne McClain and Christina Koch as an all female spacewalk but because of problems with Christina's suit and the spare suit not ready or properly sized Anne McClain sat this spacewalk out and went out with David on the next spacewalk.

Some of the battery swaps have been moved to EVA 225 and a later date because of a power failure in a Battery Charge Discharge Unit in slots 5 and 6 on the P6 Truss taking the 4B battery channel offline. Koch and Meir went outside and replaced the failed unit and brought it inside. The battery swap was moved to EVA 225 to save time and Meir and Koch wrapped up the spacewalk by installing a stanchion on the Columbus Module and tightening the bolts on the S0 Truss which had come loose. This spacewalk was the first all female spacewalk on the station. During the spacewalk, President Trump called the station and congratulated Koch and Meir on this milestone."

Parmitano and Morgan went outside and removed a cover plate from AMS and jettisoned it into space to make way for a cryo pump that they will assemble between spacewalks. Some of the bolts put up a fight but Parmitano got them all out. The highlight of the spacewalk is when Andrew Morgan threw the cover plate overboard and it drifted off aft of the station into the vacuum of space. The plate will stay in orbit for a few days until the end of December when it enters the atmosphere and burns up. The crew also removed several carbon fiber strips around fluid lines and installed handrails and grapple bars as get-ahead task. This spacewalk marks Parmitano's return to spacewalking after the Water in the Helmet Incident during EVA 171.

Spacewalk suffered a 15 minute delay when Koch lost her helmet lights and camera. Meir managed to attach a hook onto the camera to prevent it from floating away and stowed it in Koch's tool bag. The spacewalkers managed to replace two batteries plus a third as a getahead task and had to stay in signal range of the WETA antennas so Meir could check on Koch at night who did not have any helmet lights. The spacewalkers will replace the camera between spacewalks and will head back out to replace the final three batteries on the next spacewalk.

The two spacewalkers completed all the task and at 17:30 hours Luca Parmitano opened a valve to start the flow of CO2 gas to AMS and contacted CERN to turn the experiment on. AMS passed all test and worked flawlessly. A leak was found in a cooling line but Parmitano patched it and the spacewalk resumed without incident. As a getahead task Parmitano and Morgan cleaned and replaced glare filters on the NASA TV cameras used to film the spacewalk.
